# Reverse-engineering-a-ip-cctv-camera
• The goal of this project was to analyse the security measures taken by a budget IP camera, put into light what are the shortcomings to such devices when it 
  comes to protecting the data a consumer is sharing with the device
• We were successfully able to bring to light the security flaws present in the currently available sea of budget IP cameras
• We suggest the use of proven security principles like input validation, boundaries checking, access control, and authentication when creating a smart device.
